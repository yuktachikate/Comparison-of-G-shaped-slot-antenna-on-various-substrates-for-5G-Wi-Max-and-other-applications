# Comparison-of-G-shaped-slot-antenna-on-various-substrates-for-5G-Wi-Max-and-other-applications
A G-shaped microstrip slot antenna for various applications like Wi-Fi 6, Radar navigation system, satellite telecommunication, 5G application is presented. The proposed antenna structure consists of both open-ended and short-ended slots connected by a metal “via” to a microstrip line. The design is then embedded on three different substrate materials consisting of Rogers RO4003C lossy, FR4 lossy and RT5880 lossy. Dual band nature is obtained in Rogers RO4003C lossy and FR4 lossy substrate while a quad band nature is achieved when RT5880 lossy was used. The simulation and measurement results of reflection coefficient, surface current, gain, directivity, VSWR, impedance and radiation pattern are presented, which attest to the applicability of antenna.
